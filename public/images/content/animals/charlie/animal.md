## Story
Charlie was found tied to a fence post in Delft with no food or water. A concerned community member called us, and we arrived to find this little bundle of energy nearly giving up. He was severely dehydrated and had rope burns around his neck.

## Current Situation
True to his breed, Charlie has bounced back with endless energy and enthusiasm. He's a playful, spirited little guy who needs an active home. Charlie loves playing fetch and would be perfect for a family who enjoys outdoor activities.
