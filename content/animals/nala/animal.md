## Story
Nala was bought as a puppy because she was 'cute' but returned when her owners realized how much exercise and attention a Husky needs. She came to us with pent-up energy and frustration.

## Current Situation
With proper exercise and mental stimulation, Nala has become a joy. She's intelligent, athletic, and has the best 'talking' voice. Nala needs an active, experienced owner who understands Northern breeds.
