## Story
Duke was seized from a property where he was being starved and neglected. He was covered in ticks, had mange, and weighed half of what he should. Despite everything, his tail never stopped wagging.

## Current Situation
Duke has made a full recovery and is now a picture of health. He's incredibly people-oriented and loves to show off his tricks. Duke needs an adopter who can see past breed stigma to the loving soul within.
