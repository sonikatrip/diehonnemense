## Story
Cleo was surrendered along with six other cats when their owner was evicted. She was the shyest of the group, hiding in the back of the carrier and refusing to come out for days.

## Current Situation
With patience and love, Cleo has blossomed into a talkative, affectionate cat. She loves to 'chat' with her humans and has strong opinions about everything. Cleo is looking for someone who appreciates a vocal companion.
