## Story
Patches was found in a factory, having given birth to four kittens in hiding. Factory workers noticed her bringing food to a corner and called us to investigate. We found a devoted mother protecting her tiny babies.

## Current Situation
All of Patches' kittens have been adopted into loving homes. Now it's her turn. She's a sweet, motherly cat who deserves to be someone's baby for a change. Patches would love a quiet, cozy home.
