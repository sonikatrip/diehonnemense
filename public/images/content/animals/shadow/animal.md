## Story
Shadow was one of many cats living in a feral colony that was being threatened by development. We managed to trap, neuter, and socialize him before he would have been displaced.

## Current Situation
Shadow has surprised everyone with how well he's adapted to indoor life. He's quiet and independent but enjoys gentle pets when he's in the mood. Shadow would do well with a patient owner who understands cats.
