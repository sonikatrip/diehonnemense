## Story
Whiskers was found in a storm drain during routine maintenance. He was skin and bones, with a badly infected wound on his side. The workers who found him pooled money to pay for his initial vet visit.

## Current Situation
Thanks to those kind workers and excellent vet care, Whiskers has recovered completely. He's a friendly, easygoing cat who loves sunbeams and chin scratches. Whiskers would fit into almost any loving home.
