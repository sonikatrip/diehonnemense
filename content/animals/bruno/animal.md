## Story
Bruno was kept chained his entire life as a 'guard dog.' When his owners moved, they simply left him behind. He was emaciated, covered in sores, and had never known kindness.

## Current Situation
Bruno's transformation has been nothing short of miraculous. He's learned what it means to be a beloved pet and now lives for walks and playtime. Bruno is looking for an experienced owner who can give him the life he deserves.
