## Story
Luna was found wandering the streets of Khayelitsha, severely malnourished and afraid of humans. She had clearly been on her own for weeks, scavenging for food and dodging traffic. When we first approached her, she cowered and trembled, expecting the worst.

## Current Situation
After months of patient rehabilitation, Luna has transformed into the sweetest, most affectionate dog. She now greets everyone with a wagging tail and loves nothing more than cuddles on the couch. Luna is looking for a patient, loving forever home where she can continue to flourish.
