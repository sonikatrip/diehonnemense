## Story
Max was surrendered by a family who could no longer care for him. He arrived confused and heartbroken, not understanding why his family had left him. Despite his large size, Max is a gentle giant who just wants to be loved.

## Current Situation
Max has settled in well and has become best friends with several of our other rescues. He's great with other dogs and loves children. This big boy is ready for a family who can give him the space and love he deserves.
