## Story
Ginger wandered into a community outreach event we were holding, clearly having traveled far. She was footsore and exhausted but seemed to know she had found safety. She lay down at Bianka's feet and refused to move.

## Current Situation
Ginger has become one of our beloved foster fails. She's gentle, intuitive, and seems to sense when other animals or people need comfort. She's now part of Bianka's permanent pack.
