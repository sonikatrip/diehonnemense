## Story
Oscar was found hiding under a car in a parking lot during a thunderstorm. He was so matted we couldn't even see his eyes. Under all that fur was a frightened, elderly dog who had clearly been lost for a long time.

## Current Situation
After a much-needed grooming and health check, Oscar emerged as a distinguished little gentleman. He's calm, house-trained, and perfect for apartment living. Oscar would love a quiet retirement home.
