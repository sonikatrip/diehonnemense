## Story
Cooper was found trapped in an illegal snare in the outskirts of Cape Town. The wire had cut deeply into his leg, and infection had set in. He was in tremendous pain but still wagged his tail when we approached.

## Current Situation
After intensive treatment, Cooper has recovered beautifully. He's a happy, food-motivated dog who loves to follow his nose on adventures. Cooper needs a secure yard and an owner who understands his scent-driven nature.
