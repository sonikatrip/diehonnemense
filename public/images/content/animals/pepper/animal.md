## Story
Pepper was part of a hoarding case where over 30 dogs were living in terrible conditions. She was scared of everything when we first rescued her, having never experienced the outside world or human kindness.

## Current Situation
Pepper has come such a long way. She's learned to trust, play, and even demand belly rubs. She's bonded deeply with Bianka and has become one of our foster fails. Pepper is now part of our permanent family.
