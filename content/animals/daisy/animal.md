## Story
Daisy came to us as part of an unwanted litter. Her mother had been dumped while pregnant, and Daisy was born into uncertainty. From her first days, she showed a gentle, loving nature that captured everyone's heart.

## Current Situation
Now fully grown, Daisy is a beautiful, calm dog who gets along with everyone she meets. She's great with children, other dogs, and even cats. Daisy would make the perfect family pet for anyone looking for a loyal companion.
