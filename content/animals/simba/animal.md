## Story
Simba was abandoned at a local vet clinic in a cardboard box. The note simply said 'Can't afford anymore.' He was underweight and had a respiratory infection, but his purr never stopped.

## Current Situation
Now healthy and thriving, Simba is the ultimate lap cat. He loves nothing more than curling up with his humans and will follow you from room to room. Simba is looking for a quiet home where he can be your constant companion.
