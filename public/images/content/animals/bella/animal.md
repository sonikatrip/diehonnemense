## Story
Bella was rescued from a suspected fighting ring operation. She had scars on her face and body, but her spirit remained unbroken. Despite what humans had done to her, Bella showed nothing but love and trust from day one.

## Current Situation
Bella has healed both physically and emotionally. She's a certified cuddle bug who thinks she's a lap dog despite her muscular build. Bella would do best as the only pet in a home where she can be spoiled rotten.
