## Story
Honey was surrendered when her elderly owner passed away. She spent weeks at the pound before we were able to take her in. Despite her loss, Honey's sweet nature shone through her grief.

## Current Situation
Honey is a mature, gentle soul who loves routine and quiet companionship. She's perfect for seniors or anyone looking for a calm, well-mannered companion. Honey just wants to spend her golden years being loved.
