## Story
Rocky was found injured on the N2 highway, likely hit by a car. A truck driver stopped traffic to rescue him and called us immediately. Rocky's back leg was severely damaged, but his will to survive was strong.

## Current Situation
After surgery and months of rehabilitation, Rocky walks with a slight limp but doesn't let it slow him down. He's intelligent, loyal, and would make an excellent companion for an experienced dog owner who can appreciate his resilience.
