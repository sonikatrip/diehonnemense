## Story
Milo was found in a drain pipe during heavy rains. A young boy heard his cries and refused to leave until someone helped. We arrived to find this tiny, soaking wet kitten barely clinging to life.

## Current Situation
Milo has grown into a curious, playful cat who loves to explore. He's incredibly social and gets along well with other cats. Milo would thrive in a home where he has company, whether human or feline.
